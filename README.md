# water-meter-config-creator-web-application

This is a configuration support for the water-meter project. The setup is stored in a configuration file (config.ini). The creation needs some background information and therefore a web application should support here. The overview on the overall project can be found here: [https://github.com/jomjol/water-meter-measurement-system](https://github.com/jomjol/water-meter-measurement-system)

-------------------
**Update 04.09.2020:** There is an update version available, which is more compact on the hardware side and much easier from software side, because it is an all in one device. It does not need a docker container for image analysis any more as everything, including a web based configuration server is running on the ESP32
